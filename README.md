# selenium_MPN_availablity_search
I got couple hundreds of Manufacturer part no. to search if they are still available. 
this script use selenium to navigate to this site and search for these MPN scrap the data and show the status. faced challenges as site show result of similar mpn. site dont load in between. have to use different selectors to scrap and data successfully. i had not deleted and updated codes as i want to remember the mistakes and thier learnings.
MPN are in hubblescrap
final code to solve problem is in hubble.ipynb last cell only
final data is stored in hubble_final_data.csv
